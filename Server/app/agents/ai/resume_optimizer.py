        {job_description}

        Your tasks:

        1. Rewrite and optimize the resume to better match the job, making it ATS-friendly.
        2. Explicitly incorporate relevant keywords and phrases from the job description into the experience, skills, and summary sections where appropriate â€” while keeping the content truthful and professional.
        3. Preserve formatting and clarity. Ensure the structure of the resume remains clean and easy to scan.
        4. At the end, include a section titled "Changes and Rationale" with a bulleted list of the most impactful changes made and why they improve keyword alignment or clarity.

        Output the improved resume in plain text format.
