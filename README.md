## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started, just visit [this link](resum-ai-seven.vercel.app). If you'd like to run the project locally, follow the instructions below.
- **NOTE**: the initial visit of the deployed app may take a while (e.g. > 50 seconds) to boot up. This is due to the free tier of the backend hosting service used (Render)

### 🔧 Backend (FastAPI)

1. `cd` into the `Server` directory:
   - `cd Server`

2. Create a virtual environment (only if `.venv` doesn't already exist)
    - `python -m venv .venv`

3. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows command prompt: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
    - On Windows PowerShell: `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
    - On macOS/Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`

4. Install dependencies:
    - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

5. Create `.env` file
    - Create OpenAI API key and enter it into a `.env` file just like `.env.example` shows
    - Create `DATABASE_URL` with a cloud-based database host (I used Neon), and enter the connection string in the `.env` file

6. Run the backend server:
    - `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`

### 🖥️ Frontend (React + Vite)

1. `cd` into the Client directory:
    - `cd Client`

2. Install dependencies:
    - `npm install`

3. Run the development server:
    - `npm run dev`

## 🧪 Using the App

Once both servers are running, open your browser and navigate to the `localhost` URL.
